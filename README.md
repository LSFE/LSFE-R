<p align="justify">
This gitHub page displays code developed by the department of Remote Sensing of the University of WÃ¼rzburg. The LSFE package was developed to ease the internal interoperability of ongoing projects and to facilitate the transferabily of concluded concluded research. To achieve this, this package offers user-friendly functions to create a local, standardized workspace structure and a series of tools for the standardized pre-processing and data storage of satellite data that eases the communication between researchers. Additionally, <i>LSFE</i> provides assess to packages published by the department on CRAN. Follow the links bellow to check examples on gitHub!
